# Activity 3.1 - DFA Programming

## Names:
- Lucía Barrenechea A01782021
- Paula Verdugo

## Objective:
The file "DFA.rkt· determines whether a DFA (deterministic Finite Automat) is in an acceptable state. To do this 3 functions are used. The transition function that works for a predefined automat, the evaluation function and another function that indicats which transition function will be used. In this case 
it's the arithmetic-lexer function.

## What do you need?
In order to run the code succesfully it is necessary for the user to have Racket, Dr. Racket, and Magic Racket.

To run the code it is necessary to type into the terminal the following lines:

- racket -it DFA.rkt

- (arithmetic-lexer "95.3 - +34 * lu ")
